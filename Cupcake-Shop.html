    <h2 class="flavor"><strong>KeyLime Cupcake<strong></h2>
      <p>Right or wrong I’ve always viewed the cupcake as a frosting transport system, and if you’re not a huge frosting fan (I’m not), </p>
      <p>then I figured, why bother? Then I remembered a friend had mentioned a recipe from Maida Heatter that was, in her words, a “grown-up cupcake.” </p>
      <p>I figured perhaps I owed the miniature confections a chance. Ms. Heatter’s recipe, modestly entitled, “Chocolate Cupcakes” </p>
      <p>from her 1974 book “Maida Heatter’s Book of Great Desserts,” produced a rich, moist crumb that relies on cocoa powder for its deep chocolatey flavor. </p>
      <p>But it’s her topping of semi-sweet chocolate ganache that separates these cupcakes from the crowd. No buttercream, no food coloring, and no diabetic shock after consumption. </p>
      <p>Just a really nice chocolate cake that’s a bit on the small side.</p>

    <h2 class="flavor"><strong>Chocolate Cupcake<strong></h2>
      <p>Key limes are smaller than regular limes and they are also slightly sweeter which brings amazing flavor to these cupcakes. /<p>
      <p>Key lime juice and zest is in the cupcakes and the cream cheese frosting.  Yes, I used cream cheese frosting for extra flavor./<p>
      <p>Being smaller than regular limes, it does take longer to juice key limes and it takes more limes to get the juice, /<p>
      <p>but the results are worth it because there is nothing better than freshly squeezed juice. Only 3 tablespoons are needed for the whole recipe, so it’s not that bad of a task./<p>
